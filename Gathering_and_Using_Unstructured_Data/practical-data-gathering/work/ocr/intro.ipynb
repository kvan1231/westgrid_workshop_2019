    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is a class of computer-vision algorithms that seek to recognize text within images.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a real-world scenario the OCR part of a document analysis pipeline is quite small, the overall pipeline consists of ton of other things to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Preprocessing (Image cleaning): This can make or break your application, it is crucial to the functioning of such a system.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Classification: Your system will likely deal with extraneaous pages you need a way to filter these and hone in on the information you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Structure Segmentation: If you deal with complex documents you may need to recognize the structure (header, tables, body of text etc..) to refine your extraction efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "* OCR (Recognize the text): This can also involve extracting metadata (bounding boxes etc..)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Postprocessing (Text Cleaning): Like any other model, OCR models make mistakes, these need to be corrected in post processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reconstruction: If you need structured data out of your system, you'll need to restructure it (tables for example)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Information Retrieval: Getting the information you want out of the document (text search, regex, or more complicated NLP modelling)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose of the Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "This introduction differs from the others in the sense it is just a list of problems that would need to be solved in a real world application, with some short demos with the tesseract OCR Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/\n",
    "\n",
    "## Document Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "The documents presented here are a very small sample of the Tobacco3482 dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://lampsrv02.umiacs.umd.edu/projdb/project.php?id=72\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is a sample of larger set, which is itself a sample of an even larger set of documents from legal proceedings toward the tobacco industry."
