    "\n",
    "* People we're surveyed and voted for each cartoon, and those votes determined how the bracket played out. \n",
    "\n",
    "* For fun we endeavored to model the bracket and predict the outcome, but before we could do that we needed to gather the data!\n",
    "\n",
    "* to do this we took advantage of an unofficial client library for IMDb: https://github.com/alberanid/imdbpy\n",
