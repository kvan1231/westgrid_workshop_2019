1. Access double drand48(void) function from libc to get a 100 random values.
   https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_mono/libc.html

2. Use the Python version of the overlaps.py code and estimate the time to get (1000 1000000 0) run.
   Based on the shorter runs.


   Which stage of the script needs to be sped up? 

3. Measure time with the C++ code and predict the times for 1 000 000 atoms.


4. Write the third version of the C++ code with simple memory allocation on the C++ side.
   Allocate 2N arrays, find overlaps, reallocate if needed.
